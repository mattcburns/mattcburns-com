        My name is Matthew Burns. Currently I am a Senior Staff Software Engineer for Equinix Metal (formerly Packet.)
      My career has been focused around datacenter automation and bare-metal provisioning. I have worked in multiple
      datacenter facilities, doing everything from rack 'n' stack to network installation and layer 1 troubleshooting.
      Beyond that I have worked with technologies like Openstack, Kubernetes, Hashicorp tools, Ansible and more. My
      primary languages are Go and Python but I have experience in Ruby (Rails), Rust, C# and have dabbled in many
      others.

        Currently, my primary passion is in Quantum Computing. I am spending more and more of my limited free time
        (having kids will do that) learning as much as I can about the tools and hardware being used to develop this
        exciting, potentially world changing (and saving) technology.
