                <p>Hello World!</p>
                <p>
                    Like many blogs out there, I haven't been keeping up with mine. My hope is that I can change that
                with a series of new blogs posts (but we'll see lol) around things that interest me or have to do with
                my career.

                    No, it isn't a formatting issue; this site is intentionally designed with no Javascript and to be
                    HTML5 compliant. This is all 100%, hand-crafted HTML. No templating or generation used here. I
                    wanted to get back to the old school development roots of my childhood and really focus on the
                    simplicity of the "old web." So you won't find any fancy CSS or Javascript, no framework of the
                    week here. Will it create more work for myself? Yeah, probably. But I will have ultimate control
                    over how everything is formatted and I'll get to enjoy that handcrafted feeling. Plus, no silly
                    tracking to worry about and this site will display everywhere that can render HTML5. Finally, this
                    site uses Cloudflare Pages hosting. Another advantage due to the simplicity in development here is
                    the fact I can host this as a static website.

                    Site back and cruise around; hopefully this doesn't die like every other personal site I've tried
                    before ;)
